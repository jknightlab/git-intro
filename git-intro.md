# Git. The what and why. {#git}
## Why use version control?
. . .

* Keeping track of changes
* Collaborate
* Understand what happened
* Recover previous versions
* Backup

<div class="notes">
* Keeping track of changes
     - Record changes as they happen.
     - Complete version history.
* Collaborate
    - Multiple people can edit the same file without overwriting each others changes.
    - Get an overview of who changed what.
* Understand what happened
    - Each change comes with a (hopefully) useful description.
    - Did something break? Identify the change that caused the problem.
* Recover previous versions
    - Can return to any version.
    - Did something break? Just restore the last working version.
* Backup
    - Repository (on a remote server) can serve as backup.
